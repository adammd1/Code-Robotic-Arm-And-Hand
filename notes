I think to run this, we need to download the ino code to the robot.
Then, we plug it in with the tcp ip cable.

connect the ttyACM0

sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 #or whatever ACM0 we're using.

python3 neuronTest.py

It's set to go left or right by
IGNITING_NEURONS = 100 (left) or 50 right.

If you want to run the code without the robot, try neuronTestNoRobot.py.
You can also run runTests.sh, and use the printPklFile.py to decode the
spike data (from the pkl file).

To download the ino code to the robot, you need to open the arduino_ide.
Open the ino code.
Take the uno board off the shield and wires.
Connect the tcp-ip cable.
Set the permission.
sketch upload from the ide.
Disconnect the tcp-ip cable.
Put the uno board back on the shield

It should run (right) without nest.
Now you should be able to run with nest as above.
